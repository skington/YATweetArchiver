A simple Perl script to trawl your twitter timeline, saving absolutely
everything to disc.

You can then use grep or Spotlight to search through it.

You'll need to create a twitter app of your own to use it - go to
https://dev.twitter.com/ and rummage around. Then create a file called
oauth that looks something like this:

{
    consumer_key    => '...',
    consumer_secret => '...',
    access_token    => '...',
    access_token_secret => '...',
};

with the appropriate values cut and pasted from Twitter.
